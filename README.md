# 🧠 Mental Health Semantic Searcher

A project to make mental health advice from dense books more accessible through semantic search and quote-level retrieval.

## ✨ Motivation

When you're dysregulated, skimming a whole book or even a chapter can feel overwhelming. This tool helps you search for **therapeutically helpful language** based on what you're feeling or trying to express — so you can find quotes, not just concepts.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** – backend logic + semantic chunking
- **FAISS / Azure AI Search** – vector search
- **Streamlit / React (TBD)** – frontend interface
- **GitHub Actions** – CI pipeline
- **pytest** – test framework
